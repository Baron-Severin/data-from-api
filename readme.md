## Introduction

In this lab, you will be exploring the [Giphy API](https://github.com/Giphy/GiphyAPI). Use the prompts below to find the correct API call. This lab is to be done solo!

## Exercise

You have been contracted by the British Ministry of Adolescent Relationships to create an app that speaks to the youth of today in memes (the primary language of the youth of today). Given a text string, your app must use the GIPHY Translate API to convert a parent's text into it's image equivalent. Make sure there is a loading bar that persists between when the GIPHY Translate call starts and when the image finishes loading in the app. Good luck programmer!

#### Requirements

- Pull in the correct image from GIPHY Translate when a string is typed into the app
- Make sure there is a loading bar between calls in your app

**Bonus**:

- Your app allows a parent to see suggested GIPHY images from slight variations of the parent's text string.
- Your app allows a parent to invert an image associated with a parent's text
